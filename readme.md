A Discord bot

The bot response to the following commands:

'bot help' - The thing you just said. Tells you everything I can do.

'ping' - Pretty boring, just used to verify that the bot is working.

'fail' - Gives a fail award.\n" +

'f r i c k' - If any message contains this word (Minus the spaces. I don't want to ban myself!), you get banned.

'fite me <\user mention>' - Starts a fight with someone. Be wary! You might lose!

'insult <\user mention>' - Hurl a devastating insult at someone. Really not very nice.

'brawl <\multiple user mentions>' - Starts a huge brawl with everyone mentioned. There can be only one survivor!

'hug <\user mention>' - Sends a virtual hug, targeted with laser-like precision.
