# Odin

A Discord bot

The bot responds to the following commands:<br />

'bot help' - The thing you just said. Tells you everything I can do.<br />
'ping' - Pretty boring, just used to verify that the bot is working.<br />
'fail' - Gives a fail award.<br />
'f r i c k' - If any message contains this word (Minus the spaces. I don't want to ban myself!), you get banned.<br />
'fite me [user mention]' - Starts a fight with someone. Be wary! You might lose!<br />
'insult [user mention]' - Hurl a devastating insult at someone. Really not very nice.<br />
'brawl [multiple user mentions]' - Starts a huge brawl with everyone mentioned. There can be only one survivor!<br />
'hug [user mention]' - Sends a virtual hug, targeted with laser-like precision.
